# PacmanAI
## Completed for CS 6300 Artificial Intelligence @ University of Utah

### Background
This repository contains information on the multiple projects I completed during CS 6300 Artificial Intelligence. This course was broadly based on CS 188 Artificial Intelligence @ at the University of California Berkeley, including curricula and projects. The projects included implementing AI algorithms in the Pac-Man Gridworld environment to help Pac-Man win without human input. The following contains an outline and background information on which specific projects were completed. 

#### Project 1: Search
This project involved implementing search algorithms for path planning to help Pac-Man search for food and reach a particular location. The algorithms implemented include Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, A* Search, and Suboptimal Search. Additional topics covered include cost function manipulation and designing heuristics. Detailed project information can be found at the following [link](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa21/project1/#question-8-3-points-suboptimal-search).

#### Project 2: Multi-Agent Search
This project involved designing agents for classic Pac-Man, including ghosts. The algorithms implemented include Minimax Search, Alpha-Beta Search, and Expectimax Search. Additional topics covered include manipulating evaluation functions. Detailed project information can be found at the following [link](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa21/project2/).

#### Project 3: Reinforcement Learning
This project involved implementing reinforcement learning algorithms to create agents capable of learning paths to reward locations. The algorithms implemented include Value Iteration, Q Learning, Epsilon Greedy, and Function Approximation. Additional topics covered include asynchronous iteration and sweeping iteration. Detailed project information can be found at the following [link](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa21/project3/).

#### Project 4: GhostBusters
This project involved implementing Bayesian algorithms for Pac-Man to use sensors to hunt invisible ghosts. The techniques implemented include Bayes Nets, Inference, and Joint Particle Filtering. Detailed project information can be found at the following [link](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa21/project4/).
